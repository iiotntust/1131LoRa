Reference for miniLoRa nodes test. 
Arduino Nano pinout https://www.electronicshub.org/arduino-nano-pinout/
Arduino Nano supports three different types of communication interfaces. They are:
Serial: Tx, Rx 
SPI: miniLoRa module

# Detail about this hans-on
- We are using LoRa and Arduino to simulate a large farm environment with one transmitter and one receiver.
- So we have two weeks to practice this.
- Material:
- For transmitter: Arduino nano board, mini LoRa board DHT11 sensor and several wire.
- For receiver: Arduino nano board, mini LoRa board, 1.3' OLED
## Wiring diagram (Start from transmitter)
![image](picture/transmitter_wiring_diagram.drawio.png)  
> [!NOTE]
> Please ensure that the LoRa antenna is installed.
> Ensure your connection is correct so that you can view LoRa link results.

## Build up environment
- First, download arduino
> [!CAUTION]
> - Second, don't forget to download the CH340 driver if your computer hasn't installed it yet.  
> (download CH340 driver) https://www.arduined.eu/ch340-windows-10-driver-download/  
> (how to install) https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-install-ch340-driver-for-windows-11/1154087  

## Download the code
- Download code from here

![image](picture/unzip4.png)  
![image](picture/unzip5.png)  
![image](picture/unzip6.png)  
## Include Arduino library 
- We have 2 library need to include.
- 1. LoRa library
- 2. DHT sensor library  
![image](picture/lora_lib.png)
![image](https://github.com/iiotntust/1131blynk/blob/f00330f0db9a0be6d4a988c76a825adcc963ba87/picture/DHT_library.png)  
### IDE setting
* Find nano board from tool -> board -> Arduino AVR boards -> Arduino nano
![image](picture/nano_board.png)  
* Choose right processor
![image](picture/oldboot.png)  
* Find the right port from device manager
![image](picture/device.png)  
> [!CAUTION]
> If your device manager tells you the port is USB Serial(COMX) instead of CH340
> That means this nano is broken, please change another nano board.

### Uplaod the code
- After finish those setting, you can verify code and upload to nano.
![image](picture/upload.png)  
## See result(Transmitter)
* Your upload would be like this.
![image](picture/upload_done.png)  
* Open Serial Monitor  
![image](picture/Monitor.png)  
* Follow monitor setting
* Correct result would be like this.
* Also your nano will blink when data trasmit.
![image](picture/Monitor_settting.png)  
> [!CAUTION]
> If your monitor show this.  
> ![image](picture/fail.png)  
> Please press the reset botton on the nano few times until starting OK, otherwise check your wire connection, it should be wrong at somewhere.

## Wiring diagram (receiver)
![image](picture/reciver_wiring_diagram.drawio.png)  
> [!NOTE]
> Please ensure that the LoRa antenna is installed.
> Ensure your connection is correct so that you can view LoRa link results.

## Download the code
- Like how you download transmitter's code
![image](picture/unzip1_1.png)  
![image](picture/unzip1_2.png)  
## Build up environment
- We have 3 library need to include.
- 1. LoRa library
- 2. Adafruit GFX library  
![image](picture/GFX_lib_1.png)
![image](picture/GFX_lib_2.png)  
- 3. Adafruit_SH1106 library
> [!NOTE]
> This libray is special one, you can't find it on library manager.
> We have to download on internet.  
> https://github.com/wonho-maker/Adafruit_SH1106
> ![image](picture/SH1106_download.png)  
> * **Unzip the file, and put the folder in C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino (Just like how you download this hands-on's code)**
> * **Usually, Arduino's library file is in C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino**
> ![image](picture/library.png)  
> ![image](picture/library2.png)  

### IDE setting
- It is as same as transmitter's setting.
- But the port will different if you plug two device at the same time.
> [!CAUTION]
> If your device manager tells you the port is USB Serial(COMX) instead of CH340
> That means this nano is broken, please change another nano board.

### Uplaod the code
- After finish those setting, you can verify code and upload to nano.
![image](picture/upload.png)  
## See result(Receiver)
* Your upload would be like this.
![image](picture/result.png)  
* You also can see the result on receiver's screen.
* **RSSI tells you the strength of the signal you're currently receiving.**
## Additional
- **Setting spreading factor and setting different frequrency(each team can set from 850MHZ to 930MHZ)**
![image](picture/setfactor.png)  
> [!NOTE]
> **The receiver's SF must also match the transmitter's SF; otherwise, the message cannot be received.**
> ![image](picture/same_SF.png)
